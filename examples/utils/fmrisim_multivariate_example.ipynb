One way to generate both of these volumes is the mask_brain function. At a minimum, this takes as an input the fMRI volume to be simulated. To create the template this volume is averaged over time and bounded to a range from 0 to 1. In other words, voxels with a high value in the template have high activity over time. To create a mask, the template is thresholded.  This threshold can be set manually or instead an appropriate value can be determined by looking for the minima between the two first peaks in the histogram of voxel values. If you would prefer, you could use the [compute_epi_mask](http://nilearn.github.io/modules/generated/nilearn.masking.compute_epi_mask.html) function in nilearn which uses a similar method."

    "*1.4 Determine noise parameters*\n",
    "\n",
    "A critical step in the fmrisim toolbox is determining the noise parameters of the volume to be created. Many noise parameters are available for specification and if any are not set then they will default to reasonable values. As mentioned before, it is instead possible to provide raw fMRI data that will be used to estimate these noise parameters. The goal of the noise estimation is to calculate general descriptive statistics about the noise in the brain that are thought to be important. The simulations are then useful for understanding how signals will survive analyses when embedded in realistic neural noise. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now the disclaimers: the values here are only an estimate and will depend on noise properties combining in the ways assumed. In addition, because of the non-linearity and stochasticity of this simulation, this estimation is not fully invertible: if you generate a dataset with a set of noise parameters it will have similar but not the same noise parameters as a result. Moreover, complex interactions between brain regions that likely better describe brain noise are not modelled here: this toolbox pays no attention to regions of the brain or their interactions. Finally, for best results use raw fMRI because if the data has been preprocessed then assumptions this algorithm makes are likely to be erroneous. For instance, if the brain has been masked then this will eliminate variance in non-brain voxels which will mean that calculations of noise dependent on those voxels as a reference will fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "This toolbox separates noise in two: spatial noise and temporal noise. To estimate spatial noise both the smoothness and the amount of non-brain noise of the data must be quantified. For smoothness, the Full Width Half Max (FWHM) of the volume is averaged for the X, Y and Z dimension and then averaged across a sample of time points. To calculate the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) the mean activity in brain voxels for the middle time point is divided by the standard deviation in activity across non-brain voxels for that time point. For temporal noise an Auto-regressive and moving average (ARMA) process is estimated, along with the overall size of temporal variability. A sample of brain voxels is used to estimate the first two AR components and the first MA component of each voxel's activity over time using the statsmodels package. The Signal to Fluctuation Noise Ratio (SFNR) is calculated by dividing the average activity of voxels in the brain with that voxelâ€™s noise  (Friedman & Glover, 2006). That noise is calculated by taking the standard deviation of that voxel over time after it has been detrended with a second order polynomial. The SFNR then controls the amount of functional variability. Other types of noise can be generated, such as physiological noise, but are not estimated by this function.\n"

    "The temporal noise of fMRI data is comprised of multiple components: drift, autoregression, task related motion and physiological noise. To estimate drift, a number of cosine basis functions are combined. To estimate drift, cosine basis functions are combined, with longer runs being comprised of more basis functions (Welvaert, et al., 2011). This drift is then multiplied by a three-dimensional volume of Gaussian random fields of a specific FWHM. Autoregression noise is estimated by initializing with a brain shaped volume of gaussian random fields and then multiplying then creating an ARMA time course by adding additional volumes of noise. Physiological noise is modeled by sine waves comprised of heart rate (1.17Hz) and respiration rate (0.2Hz) (Biswal, et al., 1996) with random phase. This time course is also multiplied by brain shaped spatial noise. Finally, task related noise is simulated by adding Gaussian or Rician noise to time points where there are events (according to the event time course) and in turn this is multiplied by a brain shaped spatial noise volume. These four noise components are then mixed together in proportion to the size of their corresponding sigma values. This aggregated volume is then Z scored and the SFNR is used to estimate the appropriate standard deviation of these values across time. "

If you subtract this baseline then the noise becomes approximately gaussian, especially in the regions far from the brain (which is what the calc_noise algorithm considers when calculating SNR).

    "fmrisim can be used to generate signal in a number of different ways depending on the type of effect being simulated. Several tools are supplied to help with different types of signal that may be required; however, custom scripts may be necessary for unique effects. Below an experiment will be simulated in which two conditions, A and B, evoke different patterns of activity in the same set of voxels in the brain. This pattern does not manifest as a univariate change in voxel activity across voxels but instead each condition evokes a consistent pattern across voxels. These conditions are randomly intermixed trial by trial. This code could be easily changed to instead compare univariate changes  evoked by stimuli in different brain regions. "

One metric that does take account of variance, and is used below, is the signal amplitude divided by the temporal variability.
